Recently learning CSS and HTML has been an enjoyable experience. I feel like I can use CSS to style
a webpage adequately after gaining more experiences from the homeworks and WODS. Things such as padding,
coloring of background and text, etc in my opinion, has been easier to understand than coding languages.
An example of a page done using CSS is shown below.

<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="Screenshot 2023-10-04 211559.png">

This page is a simple page using ul and li to make a list as well as floating the images so that text wrap
them. It was a good example to show how CSS can be used to change specific elements of a page to mold them 
all together well.

Then I learned about Bootstrap 5 which was a lot more innovative in the way I could use it to develop a webpage.
The issue with CSS was that you had to ID certain elements if you want to style that specific element. If say I 
wanted to change my h1 to green, if I used a CSS style approach to it all of my h1 elements would be green if I
did not ID them. This changed while using Bootstrap 5 as I could change each individual part inline. A webpage 
is shown below that was made using Bootstrap 5.

<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="Screenshot 2023-10-04 211739.png">

In my own personal opinion I like using bootstrap more. I feel like I can customize things a lot better to make 
the page look more professional.
