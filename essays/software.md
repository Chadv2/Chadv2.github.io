I have been interested in software and hardware since I was in middle school. Initially the interest
in hardware came from fixing my families computer when something. Eventually that branched 
off into an interest for software.

Many things seem a lot more possible in the software side of tech at the moment with the hardware
side of it slowly catching up. The possibilities that come from what you can make as a software
engineer is what pulled me in. This is the reason why my major is in Computer Engineering at 
this time. 

I hope with the knowledge I obtain with experience that I can one day find solutions to
certain bottlenecks in the technology field. Things such as better algorithms to lighten heat 
that is produced with heavier computing or better cooling solutions that help keep this type 
of computing going.
