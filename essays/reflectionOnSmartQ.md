Looking over smart questions on Stackoverflow I found some that were really good that defined the nature 
of the question in the title. One of them was "How to handle Undefined or Empty filterQuery in Firebase Query". 
The title itself shows the bases of the question with more details in the post to pinpoint the issue the 
poster was making.

There was one "not smart question" but only because the title did not point towards what language was being used. 
This is not much of an issue though due to the tag system pointing towards SQL as the language. The rest of the context
was well written out with images of the database itself.
