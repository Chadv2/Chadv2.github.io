<p>Design patterns are organizational way of coding based off of three different classifications.
We have creational, structural and behavioral as those three classifications and each one is 
a set of templates that help identify problems in a code and come up with solutions. Each of these
categories house different ways to approach a code and we shall identify the ones I have used for 
the current ICS 314 project.</p>

<p>For example lets take the templates we use in class for the homework, all of it is reusable code 
which is a creational design pattern. For our project we used behavioral template design patterns 
to make sure our code is well structured. Currently we test our code in a local host rather than our
deployed site which is another creational design pattern called prototyping. In these ways we can identify,
solve or even avoid any problems that may occur in our code. They all work as a guidline instead of a way
of implementation for coding which in turn makes the production process more streamlined.</p>

<p>We can even say the process of using Github for our homeworks and projects is also a design pattern. The concept
of making branches to avoid issues to our main code or having it as a reusable code is in line with creational design
patterns. An example of this would be how currently for the final project the current group I work with will always 
fetch from the main code as all new changes and updates made during non class times are pushed there so we will all 
be working from the same progress.</p>
