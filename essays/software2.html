<p>Over the course of this semester I learned a lot more than I initially thought I would learn in this class.
A lot of the class was web development but in a structured and organized way that help to give first hand experience
on fundamental software engineering. I will be explaining how I learned mostly on development environments and user 
inferface frameworks below as I feel a was able to take a lot with me from those after this semester.</p>

<p>I will start with development environments first. At the start of the semester we were using JSFiddle to program simple
javascript. It got the job done but was lacking in a way to keep the code more organized. We then switched to Intellij, 
an IDE that had a lot more to offer. Intellij came with pluggable utilities that helped to mark issues or even ways to 
shorten a line of code. One of these being ESLint which is a linting utility that helped to keep the code organized and
clean. This helped to identify any issues with the code that would cause crashes on startup for the applications we were
making. It was very useful when we started integrating more framework software in our codes.</p>

<p>Speaking of framework software, lets move onto user interface frameworks. For this semester we coded in javascript to build
web applications and style them. Along the way we integrated frameworks such as Bootstrap, React and Meteor. The integration 
of all of these helped to make our codes more streamlined and allowed us to do things we could not do if we were to use only 
one, such as bootstrap. An example of the differences are shown below using screenshots of webpages we made. The first being 
Bootstrap only and the second using both Bootstrap and React.<br /></p>
