Coding standards are guidlines used to create consistent and high quality codes. 
Now that the definition of a coding standard is out of the way I can talk about 
how I feel about coding standards as a whole. To be extremely honest when I first
started using coding standards I just let the positives of it pass right over my
head. 

Those positives being how neat the codes that I make while using them look. This 
in itself is already a big help to search for any errors in syntax that I may have 
done. Take the coding standards we use in Intellij for example, that being ICS SE 
coding style. It has helped me learn how to reduce how much I type as well as keep 
my codes very organized. To put it short it has helped me achieve green check marks
while using ESLint.

Speaking of green check marks, the ESLint errors have helped me to identify when my 
code either has a issue and wont complile or if my code is off; based on the ICS SE 
coding style. It does has it's negatives as there are certain solutions suggested 
while using Intellij that could make the code do things you do not want it to do, 
an example being a infinite loop. In my honest opinion I like the positvies more than
the negatives for it though.

So overall do I think coding standards help? My answer is an absolute yes. From all the
experiences I have written above I can say that I've learned a lot more about the 
language I am using when theres a guidline to stick to.
