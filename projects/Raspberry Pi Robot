summary: "A robot I programmed using a Raspberry Pi and Python language for a Physics project."
---

Me and a team made a robot that detects metal using a Raspberry Pi and multiple sensory components. The starting design consisted of four motors connected to a motherboard that housed the cpu. Programming was done by me using the Python language. The idea was to use a PS3 remote as the input device to control the robot similar to a remote controlled car by using a bluetooth device. The final part was to mount the sensors onto the motherboard facing downwards.

The program consisted of left and right controls from the analog stick of the remote. Forward and backwards movement was inputed by pressing up or down on the analog stick. Timings for the inputs were added to the program to make the controls smoother. The final part of the program was to link the sensors to a led and alarm to signal when metal was detected. Propositional logic was used to get this to function correctly.
