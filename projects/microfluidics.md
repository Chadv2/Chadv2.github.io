PintOS was a project programmed in the C language for a class. The OS was situated in a virtual machine using Unbuntu.
Navigating the virtual machine was done using Unix while the programming of the PintOS for the assignments was done using
C. 

A lot of the work for the project was to store data in the right places. The virtual machine was allocated 4gb from my hardware
to use for the assignments. The assignments consisted of basic computing and storing the data in the right places without
breaking the OS.
