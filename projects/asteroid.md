A basic asteroid game me and a group made for a class. The game was based off the classic Asteroid shooter game with one member
doing combat design, another on UI design, and me implementing the backdrop and music. The was finished in a timespan of 2 months.

The code was done in C and the basic challenge of the game was that as your score got higher the game got faster. The backdrop
was coded to move in a cycle and eventually changed in a transition the higher your score was. The cycle for the backdrop as well
as the music sped up faster as well.
